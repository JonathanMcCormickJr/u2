# Rust U2F Library &emsp; [![MIT licensed]][MIT] [![Apache-2.0 licensed]][APACHE]

Forked from the `u2f` crate, which (as of this writing) has not been updated in years.

This is still a work in progress as I journey through the existing code and adapt it to use up-to-date dependencies and hopefully compile. I also will need to add unit tests, which are currently lacking.
